storing code

you need python(version 3.7 or below), pip, and tesseract(4.x).
They need to be added to the path in environment variable.
If they are in the path, you can type 'python' or 'pip' or 'tesseract' in terminal and get their details.

next, run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in this directory. This will help you get the modules needed to run the script.
If you get all modules successfully, you can try the script by 'python test.py'
